            "southgate, who has a degree in theology and religious studies from canterbury university, rejected catholicism and moved towards neo-pagan and heathen groups that are ‘very loyal to the gods of the northern tradition’, including the odinic rite, the tribe of the wulfings and the a ´ satru´ alliance, a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by valguard (mike) murray, a former member of the american nazi party.91 further evidence of this transition from catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with wotan, the organ of the charlemagne hammer skins.92 southgate believed that wotan’s celebration of the heroes of the norse pantheon represented ‘the most genuine expression of european spirituality, culture and identity’.93 another key expression of this ‘identity’ is exhibited by southgate’s interest in the militaristic cult of mithras and the ‘pagan spirituality’ of the apostate roman emperor julian ii.94\n",
            "\n",
            "this rejection of christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension. through the figure of christ, christianity has judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted; only the ‘weak’ continue to worship a ‘dead jew’.95 the emphasis on the judaic roots of christianity, however, is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals, sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion mithras, which was introduced into iran and india by marauding aryan tribes from the russian steppes between bce 2000 and 1500 before spreading to the roman empire. although it failed to defeat early christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century, mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers (including evola and jung) as an alternative path the west could have followed. it retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the knights templar or, latterly, himmler’s ss which, the nrf claims, had its origins in various ‘anarchist droite ’ circles l e the black sun and the thule society. while christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the ‘aryan psyche’, the awareness of europe’s ‘faustian’ destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu. these ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like evola and rene´ gue´non who discerned in them the fragments of a ‘hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth’.96 for southgate, as for evola, tradition is an ‘an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all’.97\n",
            "\n",
            "southgate’s discovery of evolian ‘primordial tradition’ and his consequent rejection of catholicism as ‘the sole cosmological truth’ ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene.98 this ‘cultural vanguard’ is spearheaded by a number of gothic-industrial, dark ambient, black and ‘viking’ metal bands, including allerseelen, blood axis, burzum, current 93, dark holler, death in june, endura, mayhem, ostara, puissance and sol invictus, though it also encompasses more commercial bands like cradle of filth.99 although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda, their music serves to diffuse the ideals of mithraic paganism and nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could, thus providing the ‘perfect antidote’ to the spiritually enervating, multiracial values of a globalizing ‘system’. southgate has also noted the potential of the straight edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers, an interesting development given (exaggerated) reports of an emerging ‘anti-anti-establishment’ pro-bush right-wing punk movement.100 although southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control music-orientated youth cultures, he believes a minority can be induced ‘to take a direction basically conducive to our aims’.101 southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine synthesis, which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews.102\n",

            "  thank you for your recent articles, including partita (penderecki), which i read with interest. when you create a new article, can you add the wikiproject assessment templates to the talk of that article? see the talk page of the article i mentioned for an example of what i mean. usually it is very simple, you just add something like {{wikiproject keyword}} to the article's talk, with keyword replaced by the associated wikiproject (ex. if it's a biography article, you would use wikiproject biography; if it's a united states article, you would use wikiproject united states, and so on). you do not have to rate the article if you do not want to, others will do it eventually. those templates are very useful, as they bring the articles to a wikiproject attention, and allow them to start tracking the articles through wikipedia:article alerts and other tools. this can help you too, as the wikiproject members will often defend your work from deletion and try to improve it further. feel free to ask me any questions if you'd like more information. | reply here \"\n",

            "the major question is, how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in?  experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab, which of course implies that given the right conditions, vast ages are not an issue.  the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains.  flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood, but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working.  much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains.  yet, how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.\n",

            "\n",
            "this rejection of christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension. through the figure of christ, christianity has judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted; only the ‘weak’ continue to worship a ‘dead jew’.95 the emphasis on the judaic roots of christianity, however, is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals, sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion mithras, which was introduced into iran and india by marauding aryan tribes from the russian steppes between bce 2000 and 1500 before spreading to the roman empire. although it failed to defeat early christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century, mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers (including evola and jung) as an alternative path the west could have followed. it retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the knights templar or, latterly, himmler’s ss which, the nrf claims, had its origins in various ‘anarchist droite ’ circles l e the black sun and the thule society. while christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the ‘aryan psyche’, the awareness of europe’s ‘faustian’ destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu. these ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like evola and rene´ gue´non who discerned in them the fragments of a ‘hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth’.96 for southgate, as for evola, tradition is an ‘an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all’.97\n",
            "\n",
            "southgate’s discovery of evolian ‘primordial tradition’ and his consequent rejection of catholicism as ‘the sole cosmological truth’ ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene.98 this ‘cultural vanguard’ is spearheaded by a number of gothic-industrial, dark ambient, black and ‘viking’ metal bands, including allerseelen, blood axis, burzum, current 93, dark holler, death in june, endura, mayhem, ostara, puissance and sol invictus, though it also encompasses more commercial bands like cradle of filth.99 although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda, their music serves to diffuse the ideals of mithraic paganism and nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could, thus providing the ‘perfect antidote’ to the spiritually enervating, multiracial values of a globalizing ‘system’. southgate has also noted the potential of the straight edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers, an interesting development given (exaggerated) reports of an emerging ‘anti-anti-establishment’ pro-bush right-wing punk movement.100 although southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control music-orientated youth cultures, he believes a minority can be induced ‘to take a direction basically conducive to our aims’.101 southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine synthesis, which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews.102\n",

            "thanks johnuniq for your advice and input. concerning the actual statement, i had already thought that after clearing things up with dvdm, i would rephrase it into something in the lines of \"\"he is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late 1970s, early 1980s.\"\" adding \"\"to some of the generation\"\" should clear your objection about the absence of stats. but that's not the really important issue here. the fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from wikipedia to declare that the (you call it blog) site is not a reliable source here, but then find that the links and statements in \"\"inertia coupling\"\" or \"\"alexander abian\"\" are significant enriching contributions to the users of wikipedia, and the sourced site is reliable there. btw, in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned, the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis. it would be highly objectionable from wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being, and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts, the links will be trashed out. at this point 1) the sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected. 2) it seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote, in most cases some synthesis is involved. 3) there is still the issue of the site being a reliable source. it seems to me that the wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay, is leading editors to substitute verifiability, intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority. this would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to wikipedia, once lauded as the place \"\"to come as you are,\"\" becoming stiff, purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding. this in turn carries into a discussion about public education, and the work that carl sagan is known to the general public for. cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so. to me the posts in the disputed site i linked to are interesting (but that maybe just my own personal opinion) and wikipedia users having them available is positive, constructive and enriching for wikipedia, and that's the reason i linked to them in the first place. throwing them out, all of them, seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things, the baby with the bath water, because a wikipedia directive says so, just because it does, not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening, it would seem to me, not to exclude good things by statute. so the reliable source rules are something i would like to discuss a bit more at length.   \"\n",
